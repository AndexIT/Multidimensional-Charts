# Multidimensional Charts with Angular, D3.js, DC.js, and Crossfilter.js

 This project is an Angular application that showcases the integration of [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), [DC.js](https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/), and [Crossfilter.js](http://square.github.io/crossfilter/) to create interactive charts with cross-filtering capabilities. The project uses a dataset with `147,150 records` in the financial domain, allowing for advanced data visualization and analytics.

## Project Features
 - `Interconnected Charts`: Use DC.js to create charts such as bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots. These charts are interconnected, allowing for cross-filtering based on various attributes.
 - `Crossfilter.js Integration`: Implement Crossfilter.js to enable multidimensional filtering on large datasets.
 - `Angular Framework`: Leverage Angular's component-based architecture for scalable and maintainable code.
 - `Financial Data Visualization`: Visualize financial data with various metrics and dimensions, providing insights into company performance, market trends, and sector distribution.

## Development Server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code Scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/ directory`.

## Running Unit Tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via `Karma`.

## Running End-to-End Tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
